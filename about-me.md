# About me

## Introduction
Software developer with 4 years of experience in the market, having good experience with open source communities.
It is my first contribution with Matrix this year as a GSoC participants, currently I am working in one of fin-tech startups companies as a full stack software developer.

Also I am currently studying communication and electronics engineering part-time.

## Open Source Contributions

I consider myself as an open source lover, I believe in open source value to the development community and improving my development skills, that's why I am trying to contribute from time to time into one of projects that I use everyday in my work, one of the most contribution I am proud of that one with ionic framework [#16851](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/16851), this one I was need to implement a `text-area` in ionic alert component in one of projects I was working on, and there was no way to do that in ionic 4 ( the version I was using this time), I thought okay lets go impalement it myself in ionic , why not ?!

As it is my final year in the collage, I think I'll have more time in the future to pay more attention to the Open source in general. and I think GSoC and Matrix will be a good station to help me to do that.

## My contributions with matrix

I didn't do too much with `Matrix` Actually in the last period I tried to  make my hands dirty in some easy issues in `element` I did make some pull requests on `matrix-react-sdk` solving some stuff, also I got familiar with `hydrogen` and it's SSO feature request, I think it was great journey to get into different matrix solutions code base.
